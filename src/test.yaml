test:
  # 1. - Take an action
  #    - Measure an outcome
  # 2. Repeat. 
  #   This will end up defining the robot's control structure.
  #   We could try to encode a behavior tree...
  #
  #
  # What you really want is a start signal, that the robot's control code
  # can consume.
  # Then, you want to specify some expectations.
  # Then, you want to specify some termination criteria.
  # Then, you *might* want to do some post processing (plot pose of object
  # X over time, overlay trajectory on map and show collisions).
